# MetaConsole

## What

- a bunch of hacks, monkey-patches, aliases etc that I used to use to
  - help investigate ActiveRecord relations
  - save typing
  - do anything else
- This is all quite disorganized and unfinished  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'meta_console'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install meta_console

## Usage

- Basically requiring this in my `.pryrc` file
  - a little more complicated than that
  - more refactoring & documentation needed
